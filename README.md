# The Consent Layer

A minimal open standard ensuring AI systems act only with clear human intent, explicit consent, and a reversible window.

## Mission

Systems must not act by accident, assumption, or emotional impulse. They must act only through clear human direction and reversible control.

Ask for consent.  
Require explicit confirmation.  
Allow undo.  
Pause when emotional.  
Human stop always wins.

Stop. Do not execute.
